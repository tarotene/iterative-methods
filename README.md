# Iterative Methods Simulator

## Overview

This repository is provided for demonstrating several *iterative* algorithms (e.g, Jacobi, SOR, CG, etc.) which mainly solves a system of linear equations with the form Ax = b.

Actual implementations are based on the textbook "Templates for the Solution of Linear Systems" written by R.Barrett et al. For more detail, please see the netlib link: http://www.netlib.org/templates/templates.pdf.

Currently we have completed up to three *stationary* methods:
1. Jacobi method,
2. Gauss-Seidel method,
3. succesive overrelaxation (SOR) method.

These stationary methods are mathematically easy to understand, and we have also provided the article about their fundamental background (written in Japanese):

## Usage

If you clone this repository, you can perform a set of experiments and visualize their results by following the steps on your environment:
1. a
2. b
3. c

Since the developed environment was (環境), these steps are to be modified according to your specific environment, but the modification would not be so difficult.

Try and enjoy your numerical experiments!
